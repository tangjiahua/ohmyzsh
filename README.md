Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.

I configured my own Oh My Zsh profile, and add some tools there, you can see at [配置我的终端](https://github.com/tangjiahua/note/blob/main/mynote/%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%88%E7%AB%AF.md)
